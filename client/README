First I started with installing npm - "npm init" 
which will executes some promts like - app name, licence, keywords, author etc.
And then I installed parcel - "npm i -D parcel"
Next react and react dom - "npm i react react-dom"
I created a file index.html which is the main file.
Running application by using the command - "npx parccel index.html"
Next created App.js as my entry file.
I added scripts to start application simple - 
 "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "test": "jest"
}
I connected the React app's entry file (app.js) to the HTML file (index.html) using a <script> tag with type="module".
Inside index.html, I created a <div id="root"></div>, and in app.js, I used ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")) to render my entire React app inside that div.
Then I installed tailwindcss which was version3. I am not getting how to use current tailwindcss. 
The command for that installation is - "npm i tailwindcss@3 postcss autoprefixer"
Next initiating the file using - "npx tailwindcss init -p"
postcss.config,js looks like - module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
And in the tailwindcss I made some changes - /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./index.html", // If you have a main HTML file in the root
    "./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx}", - Here, I just deleted the remaining file structure end points.
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
I created components names as - FinancialSummary
                              - QuickEntry
                              - MonthlySetup
                              - CreditCard
                              - History
In app.js using state variables i created tabs named with component names to display the content of the related tab when I click. 
Implemented QuickEntry tab and CreditCard tab.
Cretaed a Transactionfor which is reused in both QuickEntry and CreditCard tabs. I used props, useState, tailwindCss.
All tabs are working properly. 
Backend integration also completed.

- date ki brackets teseyali
- Scanning reciepts to autofill exxpenses
